# Wade's case of Portfoliosis

Wade Grubbs here. I created this mess on Jan 8, 2016 under the guise of Epicodus' Week 1 HTML and CSS Code Review, but I was gonna do it today anyway.

So, this thing will improve and it will host my portfolio.

This thing doesn't need any special care, just go to http://wadegrubbs.github.io in your bog-standard browser and you're golden.
