          <p><span class="aboutMe">I have worked in a digital capacity for many years, lastly as a Sys Admin at Infoworld.com. In my years as a systems administrator, it always struck me that the developers were having more fun, so here I am at Epicodus.</p>

          <p>And in case you're curious, I <em>am</em> hirable. I know! Someone like me would go groping around for filthy lucre. Because worrying about the future is <strong>very</strong> time consuming! I compile my worryings into melodic, guitarish pop songs, which I quickly forget because there is som much to worry about.</span></p>
